# XML PEM Converter

This is a C#.NET based console application to convert public and private keys between XML and PEM format, either way.

You will need .NET 6 SDK to build and run this application.

## XML to PEM
First option is to obtain PEM string from XML. Paste the XML that you have in xmlFile.xml **before** running the program.

## PEM to XML
Second option is to obtain XML string from PEM. Paste the PEM key in pemFile.pem **before** running the program.

# Credits
I was inspired by [this website](http://superdry.apphb.com/tools/online-rsa-key-converter) to make this project. Code take from [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/misaxi/4642030).

To be honest, the only reason I made this was because I didn't want to broadcast keys that I convert on the internet so wanted to make a local solution but all code and logic credits to them.
